# PPMS-entropy-calculation
Numerical calculation of entropy from PPMS measurements of magnetic nanoparticles. (magnetocaloric effect)

There is two types of measurements that we want to numerical calculate the entropy.

The first one is from isothermal measurements, With a varing fiel form 0Oe to around 50KOe.

The second one is from isofields. In this case we have the temperature varing from almost 0k to aproximaly 300k.
